Name : Syed Sagheer hussain


I have learned about digital to analog converter in this exercise. it was amazing to know about how PWM works in microcontroller.
I have not implemented the vibrational sensor. it was a bit difficult to understand how to use piezo buzzer as an input as well as an output.

could you please guide me about this ?
