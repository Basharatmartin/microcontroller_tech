Comments:

Please add your name to the file you hand in.

The clock-function is wrong! (compare to that I send you via e-mail)
To read in PB1, PB2 and PB3 you first must use parallel input of SREG1, then
switch to the right shift mode. Otherwise you are unable to read in the buttons.

Neither in the code nor in the function of the program I see a structure that
would allow to return to initial operations.

The program only responds to the buttons, when D1 is illuminated. The rotating
light has not been implemented.

Direction and speed of the play function are all right. The play function does
not work as intended and the button PB3 can't be determined; the principal
structure is ok, therefore half a point.

Rewind does work.

To hand out solutions that fullfil all the tasks perfectly is not our purpose.
What I can do is that I send you an e-mail later this week (maybe on Friday) 
with a structure that describes (in words) how a program could look like and maybe some crucial
parts of code. Start working on exercise no. 4 on time; exercise no. 3 is known
to be one that causes problems to a lot of students.
