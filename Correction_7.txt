Comments:

I haven't had the problem with the red LED on my bord; the reason for
your problem is very likely to be found in your temperature control 
(that's also the reason you only get half a point for that):
You get problems when the temperature is exact on the border of a range.
Then the order to turn on or turn off the heater may be too late to
make sure that the temperature stays within the ranges three and four
under all circumstances. Instead use the values you get from the ADC and
use borders within the ranges.

Where is the 4 second watchdog intervall for task 1b)? The LED blinks at 2 Hz.

To trigger the relay using REL_DYN even when
you're stuck in an endless loop, you can use the timer
interrupt. That interrupt needs to be triggered with a very
high frequency - at least on my bord it is much higer than 200 Hz.
In the interrupt you toggle P3.5 (X4). 
Additionally, you have to ensure that the temperature is
displayed every two seconds; for example by saying that
it is displayed every 2600th interrupt (that's the number
in my code).
