Comments:

To be honest, I don't see problems on how the tasks are supposed
to be solved - if you are unsure you can always ask me or write into the
forum. Unfortunately I have to correct as the tasks are intended to
be solved.

Variables used within the interrupt service routine (ISR) should be declared
as 'volatile'.

On some points in your code the structure may be right, but then you
do exactly the opposite of what you should do (for example in line 85:
you say that you turn off all the LEDs; in fact you're turning on the 
blue one).

The blue LED is supposed to be turned on, whenever PB5 and PB6 are
being pressed at the same time; in your code the blue LED is on,
except when PB5 and PB6 are being pressed.

The yellow LED should be turned on, WHENEVER PB5 is NOT being pressed.

You only get one point for the ISR because it can only be used once;
don't turn it off (line 97)!
